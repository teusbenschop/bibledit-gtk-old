        Introduction to Collaboration
      </h1>
      <p>
        With Bibledit several users can work on one Bible at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The users collaborate through the network or a USB drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once everything has been set up, the user needs to Send/Receive the data, and the rest goes automatic. The user does not notice the mechanics of the collaboration, it all happens under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a variety of methods for collaboration. The user who will set it all up needs to have sufficient knowledge of information technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit stores all data locally. When collaboration is enabled, it also connects to a central repository. Through that repository the data gets shared between the users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content manager. The user does not notice that Git is used. He does not operate it. Bibledit does it all for him. The only thing that the user notices is that the changes introduced by the other users appear on his screen too.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a variety of repositories that can be used. Each of them has it own use, advantages and disadvantages. First of all there is the repository that resides on a file system. A <span style="font-weight:bold">USB flash drive</span> can be used in this case. This flash drive can be physically moved from one user to the other, and so on, updating each user, and getting updated by each user. Secondly there is the repository that resides on the network. For internal networks a simple <span style="font-weight:bold">open network repository</span> can be used. Whosoever knows where the repository resides can write to it. For public networks such as the internet a <span style="font-weight:bold">secure network repository</span> would be recommended. This type of repository is locked down. Only those who have the keys to such a repository can write to it.
