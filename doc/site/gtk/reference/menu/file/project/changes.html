        The assistant for viewing changes in a project is accessible through menu File / Project / Changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can show you the changes that have been made in the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. You can view the changes since your last review.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. You can view the changes made a date and time to be chosen by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. You can view the changes that have been made between two dates and times to be chosen by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        After pressing Apply, some processing will be done and then the changes will be presented to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note. If a change is made in the text, and the changes are requested straight after that, the change may not have been recorded yet. In that case wait a short while and do it again.
