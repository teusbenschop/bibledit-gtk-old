        Generate Word lists

      </h3>
      <p>
        The dialog to generate the word lists is available through the menu, Tools, Generate word lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        It generates a general word list, a list of Hebrew words, and one of Greek words.
      </p>
      <p>
        It goes through all the data in the project, collects the entries which have been marked, and then inserts the lists at a location defined by the user. Thus it can generate a glossary or topical index.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="settings" href="" id="settings"></a>Settings
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are three possible lists: a general word list, a Hebrew word lists, and a Greek word list.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each of these lists there are some options that the user can set:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Process word list: whether to process this particular word list.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Add an asterisk to each entry, see below.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Add the asterisk only to the first time this particular entry occurs in the section, see below.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="operation" href="" id="operation"></a>Operation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Generating word lists is simple assuming that the right markers are already in the data: Just set the options, click button OK, and wait till it is through.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="entries" href="" id="entries"></a>Entries
      </h3>
      <p>
        The word list generator uses the entries that are in the data to collect the words to insert in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        An entry for the general word list is inserted between the \w and the \w* markers. The Hebrew and Greek word lists use similar markers. See the <a href="javascript:void(0);">USFM</a> documentation for full details
      </p>
      <p>
        When the word list generator runs, it will remove any asterisks (*) that were appended to the word. When the option "Add an asterisk to each word entry" has been selected, it will then add an asterisk after the word. If the option "the first time it occurs in a section" has been selected also, it will only add the asterisk where this particular entry occurs for the first time in the section. In this case, if for example the word "talent" occurs several times in a section, it will be given as "talent*" the first time, with the asterisk, and as "talent" the other times, without an asterisk. The section headings define the size of a section.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="lists" href="" id="lists"></a>Lists
      </h3>
      <p>
        The lists of words can be inserted once or more than once in the data. The general word list will be inserted between the markers \zopenwordlist and \zclosewordlist. These markers ought to be on a separate line. If this couple of markers occurs in several places, the word lists will be inserted in several places too. If it occurs once, only one list will be generated, and if it does not occur at all, no list will be generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any entries that are already between those markers will be preserved. If there are entries between those markers, and there is no corresponding entry in the text, this entry will be commented out.
      </p>
      <p>
        List of usfm markers that indicate the position of a word list:
      </p>
      <pre>
\zopenwordlist<br />\zclosewordlist<br />\zopengreekwordlist<br />\zclosegreekwordlist<br />\zopenhebrewwordlist<br />\zclosehebrewwordlist
</pre>
      <p>
        The markers that open and close a word list will need to be manually typed in the text at the right location. They are not part of the stylesheet.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="example" href="" id="example"></a>Example
      </h3>
      <p>
        Consider the following situation:
      </p>
      <p>
        The text contains the following general word list entries: Hallelujah, Rabi, Pentecost.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some place of the data, the list should be inserted, but it already contains some entries:
      </p>
      <pre>
\zopenwordlist<br />\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord<br />\p Rabi: Teacher<br />\p Mamon<br />\zclosewordlist
</pre>
      <p>
        After running the word list generator, it will look so:
      </p>
      <pre>
\zopenwordlist<br />\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord<br />\rem Mamon<br />\p Pentecost<br />\p Rabi: Teacher<br />\zclosewordlist
</pre>
      <p>
        Note the following: (1) the existing entries have been preserved, (2) a new one has been added, (3) one has been commented out, and (4) the entries have been sorted alphabetically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that any text before the first colon (:) is considered to be the actual entry. If there is no colon, then the whole text will be considered the entry.
