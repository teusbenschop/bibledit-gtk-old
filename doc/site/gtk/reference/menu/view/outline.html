      <p>
        Bibledit shows the outline of the book that is being edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outline can be seen in the Outline window, accessible through the View menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the headers and titles that are in the book are visible there, with the chapters and verses they start with and end with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The header or title that has the cursor will be focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you double-click on any header, or press Enter, the chapter belonging to that will be loaded in the editor.
      </p>

        Notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Headers and titles that are in chapter 0, that means, before chapter 1, do not show up as such, but as chapter 0 without any verse-references.
      </p>
      <p>
        - There are no heading endmarkers if the heading is followed by another one.
