        6 October 2009
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of bugs were fixed, one of them related to importing raw text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The KJV Bible from the Sword project was made part of Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The keyterms per verse and their renderings show again. The system was extended.
      </p>
      <p>
        The window that shows the keyterms in a verse has clickable keyterms and Strong's numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The references window has been redone. It now looks and feels like a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The translator can display a window with related verses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The related verses window shows the keyterms in the verse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The related verses window shows the Strong's numbers in the verse and where these occur elsewhere in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The related verses window shows the parallel passages in the Old and New Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The references window shows the verse text of the active editor, and of the King James Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The management of hidden references is now done from the references window itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Quick References area was removed and its functionality was integrated into the References Window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons for go-back and go-forward got a history menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Import Assistant was added replacing all the separate import routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The import of the kosher Yemenite Hebrew text produced by Mechon Mamre was moved to the Maintenance dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requires program "chmsee" for viewing .chm help files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Works with BibleWorks 8, with older versions, and probably with newer ones too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bibledit Windows Outpost code has been released under the GPL, and the compiled Windows executable is included with the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of bugs in relation with the GoBibleCreator were fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honours the book selection during search or during replace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bibledit Windows Outpost no longer shows on startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search limits were fixed for search and for replace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can send references to the Online Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can receive the current reference from BibleWorks, and from Paratext and applications that can exchange references with it, and from the Online Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requires libdbus-glib-1-dev.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can send verse references to Xiphos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can send verse references to and receive them from BibleTime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dialogs that are too tall for a small screen are automatically scaled to fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Verses" window has been removed. Its functionality is available much better in Xiphos, BibleTime, the Online Bible, and BibleWorks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dan created an autobuilder for windows builds, see http://buildbot.biblesint.org/waterfall.
