      <p>
        8 December 2005
      </p>
      <p>
        Bugs have been fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check "compare usfms" has been added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening a project was made more user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check-Markers-Validate also detects any markers not in the stylesheet of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Directory /tmp/bibledit has been made world writable so that running bibledit as root for the first time does not create subsequent access problems if bibledit is ran after that as a normal user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minor improvements in the user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check-Characters-Inventory was added: counting characters used in a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        A problem with autocompletion in the find functions was solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system log from the previous session of Bibledit can be shown too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time consuming shell processes, such as in the character inventory, show a moving progress bar for better feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit now runs on Mac OS X as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check-Words-Capitalization was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crash, when indexing text and searching text at the same time, was solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic search had gotten slow, but was brought up to speed again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Searches can be done in the raw USFM text, or all the text, or in any of the following categories: identifiers, introductions, headings, chapter text, study notes, foot- and endnotes, crossreferences and verse text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The helpfile was updated with information about searching, and how to report bugs are request new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        "For scholar" was added to the notes categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit was updated to allow for printing on Mac OS X, using Java and FOP.
      </p>
      <p>
        A check for repeating words was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A check for matching pairs of punctuation was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A check for unwanted patterns of characters was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A check for unwanted whole words was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the online help and http://bibledit.sourceforge.net got a facelift.
