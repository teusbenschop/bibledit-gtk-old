        Version 1.3
      </h1>
      <p>
        16 January 2006
      </p>
      <p>
        Minor bugs were fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improvements to the user interface were made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imports and exports Bibledit stylesheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internal optimizations in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requesting next or previous verse crosses the chapter boundary, and next or previous chapter crosses the book boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handles combined verses such as 1-4 or 2b-5 or 1,3 for navigation, searching and notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The character inventory also gives the hexadecimal notation of a character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit needs package fontconfig to print Unicode characters without manual labour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit no longer supports FOP because this renderer is incapable of meeting all of Bibledit's requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit no longer supports XSLFormatter because it is not likely anybody will ever pay so much for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properly renders Unicode characters when printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined verses, such as 10-12a, render properly when printing the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The style(sheet) system has been overhauled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some fixes and changes in the character count check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improved font selection for printing with the option of using all fonts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acrobat Reader for Linux is supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a long printing session the progress bar no longer hangs at 100 percent, but keeps moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great number of refinements were introduced in the stylesheet system making it more user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The automatic update routine for older stylesheets was removed because it caused trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressbar takes the whole width of Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inserting standard text in a note erases anything that was selected at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Double-clicking a style in the Styles Area, while the edit mode is on, edits the style.
