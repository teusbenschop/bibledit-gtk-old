        Version 1.9
      </h1>
      <p>
        8 August 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improvements in the user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improvements in the USFM import routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bug was fixed in the marker validation check.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text storage and retrieval engine was upgraded for higher speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bug was fixed in the Bible notes processing when a note contained unmarked text.
      </p>
      <p>
        When exporting to BibleWorks, which does not handle combined verses, Bibledit converts combined verses to simple ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit Windows Outpost version 1.6 prevents BibleWorks from copying its verses to the clipboard when scrolling with Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project notes database was upgraded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internal changes were made to reduce the memory usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Bible in the Parallel Bible will be printed using its own preferred font.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imports Hebrew text with vowels and cantillation marks from http://www.mechon-mamre.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can cut visually ordered Hebrew text into shorter lines for better printouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The font size can be set in several printouts, like the parallel Bible, references, changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Text that would go in a new paragraph, according to the stylesheet, now is written in that new paragraph, in the parallel Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Word Inventory was added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bug was solved that cut off the last digit of a verse number, in case the verse did not have text. This occurred in printing a project and export to Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bug fix: Keeping an arrow key pressed down in the text area for a longer time caused the navigation system to be mixed up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The line height can be set for the printouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bug in the synchronization of BART with Bibledit was solved, if the navigation keys were kept pressed down and repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bug fix: New text added to the very end of a Bible note was not saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Bibledit starts, and another instance of Bibledit is already running, it will give a message, and refuse to run.
      </p>
      <p>
        The available styles are now divided into 20 categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improved inserting of the styles w, wg and wh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shows a maximum of 30 styles in the Recently Used category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project notes are now sorted not only on the first reference, but on any additional ones as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project notes allow for references that span the chapter boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Bibledit stores a line of text, any line that does not start with a backslash is joined to the previous one, in agreement with the USFM standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Runs on x86_64 operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The index was removed, because the new text retrieval engine is so fast that the index is not needed anymore, and the indexer was slow anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can limit searches to the the currently opened chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The speed of advanced searching was drastically improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faster highlighting of searchwords in case of a basic search. Noticeable in very long verses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching in areas only highlights results in those areas, no longer results outside them.
