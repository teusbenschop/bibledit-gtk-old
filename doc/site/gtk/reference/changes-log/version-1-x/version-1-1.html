      <p>
        2 November 2005
      </p>
      <p>
        Bugs have been fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Documentation has been released under the GPL instead of GFDL.
      </p>
      <p>
        USFM 2.03 information has been included with the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        Startup and shutdown splashscreens give percentage ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progress shows better during formatting documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various improvements in the graphical user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching can now also add any results to the existing references.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some values and settings are stored permanently, and others only during one session of bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search functions will not work unless something to look for has been entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log is now on the site and in the online help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Search Special functions have been expanded with many more options to find text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Words entered in search dialogs, and other dialogs, automatically complete based on previously entered values.
      </p>
      <p>
        All comboboxes have been updated to the newest version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ctrl+G, to go to another reference, has been expanded with aided entry of the reference to go to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit can follow the same reference as BibleTime shows. Needs BibleTime version 1.5.2 or higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit now utilizes project scripturechecks, see the Check menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        A versification system can be set in Properties, and is used in the Scripture checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keyboard shortcuts have been added for going to previous/next reference in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Find" and "Find special" are no longer separate, but in one and the same dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solved a race condition in bi-directional exchange of references between Bibledit and BibleTime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit can search in BibleTime modules. Needs BibleTime version 1.5.2 or higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some checks were implemented: Chapters and Verses, Count Markers, Validate Markers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The checks got a book-selection and options dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shutting down Bibledit immediately after opening a freshly created project could take more than five minutes because Bibledit was indexing that project. Shutdown is now faster because indexing will be postponed to the next time Bibledit starts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a new note while a note is being edited no longer discards the current note that is being edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any reference in the reference area can be hidden for the future, so that it won't show up again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keyboard shortcuts were added to the book selection dialog, to make selection easier for people who prefer the keyboard rather than the mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is now able to print books which have the first chapter marker missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit now deals a bit more careful with BibleTime so that BibleTime does no longer crash when it is restarted
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating templates for books is done much faster.
