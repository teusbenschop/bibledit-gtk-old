        When entering Bible notes, the user can set the size of the content entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        When pressing "New" while entering Bible notes, the current layout of the dialog is preserved instead of zeroed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Bible note is erased, it will be taken out completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        When scrolling through the Text Area, the cursor tries to stay at 30% of the screen height, near the top.

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit can sort the project notes so that the ones with the most relevant references are nearest the cursor in the notes area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The \c line cannot be edited, so nobody can fiddle with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools are available to edit the chapter number or insert a new one.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Tracks the usage count of the markers and sorts them on this count in the recently used category, the one used mostly first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Description of the styles in the Styles Area was updated, to reflect whether the closing marker is absent, optional or obligatory.
