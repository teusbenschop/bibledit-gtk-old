Source Language King James Bible

August 2009

We use two sources and create a combination that combines the best elements of the two.

Source: SWORD library

How to create it:

If the SWORD api is installed on Linux, install the KJV Bible.
Then, give the following command:

mod2osis KJV > swordkjv.xml

This produces the file. 


Source: Zefania XML Bible Markup Language
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/
KJV+ Strongs

Download the files, and unpack it to sf_kjv_strongs_rev1b.xm,
then rename this to zefaniakjv.xml.


The Strong's tags of the Zefania files are better than the ones of the SWORD library.

It is important for Bibledit that both these names are used. 
It looks for it on startup, and creates a database out of it.


September 2009 Update
The above has changed.
The kjv.sql database is now standard included with the Bibledit package.
It no longer creates it once on startup.
To create the database or update it, use Bibledit menu Tools / Maintenance.
