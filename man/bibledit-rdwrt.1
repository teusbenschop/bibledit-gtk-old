.SH NAME
.B bibledit-rdwrt \- Read or writes data to or from a Bibledit-Gtk Bible or project
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bibledit-rdwrt can read from or write to Bible data.

Syntax: bibledit-rdwrt \(hyr|\(hyw project book chapter|0 fileName

Breaking the syntax down we have:

First parameter: \(hyr|\(hyw 
This can be either \(hyr or \(hyw which determines whether the remaining arguments are going to do a "read" operation 
from the specified Bibledit-Gtk Bible / project, or do a "write" operation to that Bible / project.

Second parameter: project 
This gives the name of the Bibledit-Gtk Bible / project. 
All we have to do is ensure that the project name we want to access is a valid/existing one.

Third parameter: book
This is simply the 3\(hyletter book code for the Bible book that is being read/written to.
I.e., MAT for Matthew, GEN for Genesis, etc.

Fourth parameter: chapter|0
This can be either a chapter number or 0 (zero) for reading/writing either an individual chapter 
or reading/writing a whole book (when the parameter is 0). 

Fifth parameter: fileName
This is a temporary file name that we assign for our use with bibledit-rdwrt.
For a read (\(hyr) operation this fileName argument is the name of the file that will be created by bibledit-rdwrt
containing a copy of the whole book (corresponding to the 3\(hyletter code), 
or that contains the individual chapter contents (of a designated chapter) of an existing Bibledit-Gtk book file
in the Bible / project. It should be prefixed with a path us. 
For a write (\(hyw) operation this fileName argument is the name of the temporary file that bibledit-rdwrt reads 
to get the text which it then writes to the appropriate Bible / project file. 
The temporary file can contain the text of a whole book, or just the text of a single chapter 
for the book specified by the book 3\(hyletter code and the chapter (number) argument. 

bibledit-rdwrt may exit with 0 on success, or \(hy1 on failure, as it sees fit.
It may write to stdout or stderr, as it sees fit.
