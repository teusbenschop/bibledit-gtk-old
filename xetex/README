The ptx2pdf package is described at https://sites.google.com/a/icapmail.org/ptx2pdf/

The software is kept in a Subversion (version control) repository. You can access this in several ways:

- http://scripts.sil.org/svn-view/sfscripture/TRUNK/ptx2pdf/ 
- svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/sfscripture/TRUNK/ptx2pdf

(There is also ptxplus at "hg clone http://hg.palaso.org/ptxplus". It should do a little more than ptx2pdf).
