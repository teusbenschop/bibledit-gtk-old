The file usfmReference[version].chm.zip was downloaded from the above URL,
unzipped and saved as usfmReference.chm.

On 4 August 2009 Jeff Klassen of the Canadian Bible Society gave
permission to distribute this file: 

"Please feel free to distribute the current version of the CHM help file. 
We're glad that the documentation can be of help."

Since it does not come with a license, it is supposed that the file is
in the public domain.

To view this documentation in .chm format, a program called chmsee was used.
People said that this program is not available for Mac OS X.
For that reason the .chm file was extracted into its components.

To extract, move the .chm file to the usfm subdirectory of this package,
then unpack it:
extract_chmLib usfmReference.chm .
Then remove the files that start with $ or #.

It produces .htm files and other files. Since the suffix of the files is .htm, 
these files shouldn't interfere with Bibledit's online help, which uses .html.

Stylesheet usfm.sty ships with Bibledit.
Updates are available from http://confluence.ubs-icap.org/display/USFM/Home

On 30 January 2010 Jeff Klassen of the Canadian Bible Society gave
permission to distribute this file: 

"There is no problem with you making use of the usfm.sty file in this way."

Since it does not come with a license, it is supposed that the file is
in the public domain.

The Debian FTPmasters rejected the package for inclusion with Debian.

This were their concerns:

bibledit-gtk-4.2/usfm/{$FIftiMain,$OBJINST}
Don't know what these files are

bibledit-gtk-4.2/usfm

Uhm... No.  The author statement doesn't grant all rights required by
the DFSG, and "supposing" it's public domain is not enough. Beside:
That's not mentioned in your debian/copyright either.

bibledit-gtk-4.2/usfm/helpman_topicinit.js:
"It is designed for use in combination with the output of Help & Manual
and must not be used outside this context."
What is this file?  May I edit it?  May it be distributed?  Who's the
copyright holder?

Best regards,

Alexander


Because of this, all files that were of concern have been removed
for the time being, till such time that all concerns have been 
addressed.
